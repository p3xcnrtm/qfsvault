</p>
<h3>User representations and warranties</h3>
<p>
By using our Services and LOBSTR wallet software, in particular, you represent and warrant that you acknowledge, understand, and accept the risk of the following:
<br />
<br />
LOBSTR wallet is provided to you by Ultra Stellar, LLC, an independent commercial entity unaffiliated with the Stellar Development Foundation. LOBSTR wallet is only a user interface to Stellar and does not operate the Stellar Network. LOBSTR wallet is not an exchange. LOBSTR wallet is unable to control the actions of others on the Stellar network. When using LOBSTR wallet, you are directly communicating with the Horizon Stellar API and the Stellar network operated by a decentralized network of several trusted organizations running validators.
<br />
<br />
When you create a wallet on the Stellar network ("Stellar account"), LOBSTR wallet software generates a cryptographic public and secret key pair that you may use to send and receive Stellar lumens ("XLM") or any supported cryptoasset on the Stellar Network.
<br />
<br />
Upon the creation of your Account or upon further usage, LOBSTR wallet may change the "home_domain" and "inflation_destination" of your Stellar account, unless your Stellar account participates in the paying inflation pool.
<br />
<br />
You are solely responsible for storing, outside of the Services, a backup of your Stellar account, secret key or transaction information that you maintain in your LOBSTR Wallet or otherwise with the Services. If you do not maintain a backup of your Stellar account secret key outside of the Services, you may not be able to access XLM or any supported cryptoasset previously accessed using your LOBSTR wallet in the event that we discontinue or no longer offer some or all of the Services or may otherwise lose access to XLM or any supported cryptoasset. We are not responsible for maintaining this data on your behalf. Transaction and Stellar account data can be viewed as a piece of public information on the Stellar Network and can be found using blockchain explorers.
<br />
<br />
LOBSTR wallet is not a custodian of your Stellar lumens or any other cryptoassets issued on the Stellar Network. We do not have access to your tokens, cryptoassets, secret keys or Account passwords. LOBSTR wallet is only capable of supporting Stellar Lumens and other cryptoassets issued on the Stellar Network. Under no circumstances should you attempt to store an asset no matter whether it would be considered a currency, commodity, security, utility token, or another type of asset in your LOBSTR wallet that LOBSTR wallet does not support.
<br />
<br />
In order to be completed, any Virtual Currency transaction created with the Wallet must be confirmed and recorded in the cryptocurrency ledger associated with the Stellar Network.
<br />
<br />
Lobstr has no control over Stellar Network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction details you submit via our Services will be confirmed on the Stellar Network. You agree and understand that the transaction details you submit via our Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed by the Stellar Network used to process the transaction.
<br />
<br />
Once transaction details have been submitted to the Stellar Network, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction or transaction details. Lobstr.co has no control over the Stellar Network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests. All transaction requests on the Stellar Network are irreversible.
<br />
<br />
Lobstr does not currently charge a fee for LOBSTR wallet, receiving, sending or controlling XLM or any other supported cryptoasset issued in the Stellar Network. However, we reserve the right to do so in the future, and in such case, any applicable fees will be displayed prior to you incurring the fee. Network fees required to make transactions on the Stellar Network may apply to a transaction. We may attempt to calculate such a fee for you. Our calculation may not be sufficient, or it may be excessive. You are solely responsible for paying any such fee and Lobstr will neither advance nor fund such a fee on your behalf, nor be responsible for any excess or insufficient fee calculation.
<br />
<br />
You must assume all risk of: (i) guarding and storing your cryptoassets, tokens and secret keys, (ii) auditing the quality, security, value, and merit of the assets that you transact, (iii) auditing the legality and legal compliance of your transactions of all assets with any counterparties, (iv) auditing counterparties with whom you create a trust line, and (v) using the Services to perform any operation or transaction.
</p>
<h3>No endorsements</h3>
<p>
Asset listings on LOBSTR wallet are not endorsements. LOBSTR wallet is a software client ONLY and does NOT conduct any independent diligence or review of any asset issued on the Stellar Network.
<br />
<br />
Stellar is an open system meaning that scams and market manipulators may exist. Prices shown on LOBSTR wallet or through the Services are for informational purposes and do not imply that they can actually be redeemed for a certain price.
<br />
<br />
Lobstr has no control over the development, operation, management, marketing, or any other activity of any of the assets that are displayed on Lobstr.co website or otherwise made available through the Service and LOBSTR wallet.
<br />
<br />
Any information displayed on Lobstr.co website or otherwise made available through the Service, regarding an asset is community-sourced and may be incomplete or inaccurate.
</p>

<br />
<br />
Risk of loss in using Services involving XLM and cryptoassets may be substantial and losses may occur over a short period of time.
